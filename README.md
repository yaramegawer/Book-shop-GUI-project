Book Shop Project
The Book Shop GUI project is an online bookshop that allows users to buy or rent books from the comfort of their own home. The project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for customers to navigate and find the books they are looking for.
In Form One of the project, the user is prompted to enter their username and password. These two labels are essential for authentication purposes, as they ensure that only authorized users can access the website. We have used the try statement and catch statement to handle any errors that may occur when the user enters their data. This ensures that the user receives a clear message if they enter incorrect information.
In addition to the username and password labels, Form One also contains four buttons that perform specific functions. The first button is the "Buy" button, which allows users to purchase books from the shop.

The second button is the "Rent" button, which enables users to rent books for a specific period. The third button is the "Customers data" button, which saves the information about all the customers who have made purchases or rentals from the bookshop in the first data base table. Finally, the fourth button is the "Admin" button, which adds more books with its name, id, and price and saves it in the second data base table and manage the bookshop's inventory and other administrative tasks.
Every button got a specific Job :

There will be two labels on the form: the first label asks for the quantity of books that the user wants to buy, and the second label displays the total price of the selected books. The user will also see two checkboxes that ask if they want to pay by visa or cash. Finally, there will be two buttons: Done and Exit.
To implement this feature, we used classes and objects to manage the buying process. We also used conditional statements like if and else if to determine which book the user selected and to calculate its price based on the quantity selected.

When the user completes the buying process, they can click on the Done button to finalize their purchase. If they change their mind or want to cancel their purchase, they can click on the Exit button to leave Form Two without buying any books.
